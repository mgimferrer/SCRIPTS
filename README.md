Scripts developed and tested over the years by myself, together with brief description of each one of them

### JOB-SUBMIT

Collection of scripts for creating launcher jobs and submitting them to a Slurm-based queue system. Minimal modification make them usable to any cluster

(Examples on how to execute)

### G16-TO-XYZ

Python script to extract the geometry of a molecular system from a G16 output file (.log) and printing in an independent file or .xyz format. For single-point or optimization+frequency calculations, only the optimized geometry is provided. For scans and IRC calculations, the geometries at each step are extracted and gathered in the created .xyz file
